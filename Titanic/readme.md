# Titanic Survivors - An exercise in machine learning
### CS 634 - Prof Monogioudis

## Overview
We will utilize the methods of machine learning to predict survivors of the Titanic disaster based on the passenger features. While the Ames Housing Data was based on linear regression to predict a price value, this exercise is one of categorization, specifically binary classification. This project as an applied exercise in data engineering and data science, specifically utilising the tools of feature selection, feature engineering, and modeling through classification. Refer to the python notebook for the specific analysis.

## Running the notebook

Using Google Colaboratory, import the Python notebook .ipynb file. Upload the 3 csv files found in the data folder on github into the Colaboratory runtime. They should go into the content folder automatically, but ensure they are there.
1) gender_submission.csv
2) test.csv
3) train.csv
Next Run All segments (Runtime --> Run All). In the Files slider, you should now see a submission.csv. That is our predictions on the test data.
