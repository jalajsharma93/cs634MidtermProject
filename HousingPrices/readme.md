# Predicting Housing Prices for the Ames Data Set
### CS 634 - Prof Monogioudis

## Overview
We will utilize the methods of machine learning to predict the sale price for houses based on the Ames data set. This project as an applied exercise in data engineering and data science, specifically utilising the tools of feature selection, feature engineering, and modeling through linear regression. While we explore a number of different methodologies, we found feature engineering and stacking of regression models to have the higest impact. Refer to the python notebook for specific details on our methods. 

## Running the notebook

Using Google Colaboratory, import the Python notebook .ipynb file. Upload the 3 csv files found in the data folder on github into the Colaboratory runtime. They should go into the content folder automatically, but ensure they are there.
1) sample_submission.csv
2) test.csv
3) train.csv
Next Run All segments (Runtime --> Run All). In the Files slider, you should now see a final submission.csv. That is our predictions on the test data.
